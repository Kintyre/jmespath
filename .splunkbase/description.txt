JMESPath for Splunk expands builtin JSON processing abilities with a powerful standardized query language.  This app provides two JSON-specific search commands to reduce your search and development efforts:

* jmespath - Precision query tool for JSON events or fields
* jsonformat - Format, validate, and order JSON content

In some cases, a single jmsepath call can replace a half-dozen built-in search commands.  Sound too good to be true?  The jmespath command can parse nested JSON strings and unroll arrays of {Name: x, Value: y} hashes with ease.  Checkout the examples and try it yourself!

NOTE:  The 1.0.x series is stable and the 1.9.x release are in preparation for 2.0.0. Some backwards compatibility changes are planned and several things aren't yet set in stone.  Contact us if you have any concerns or would like to be involved.

Too long for now, but stuff to keep for after the 1.0 vs 2.0

All app development is open and accessible on GitHub.

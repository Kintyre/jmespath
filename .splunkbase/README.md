# Splunkbase content synchronization

This directory contains text files to synchronize the Splunkbase app description and details pages.
This is currently a manual operation, but since Splunkbase doesn't store a history of these artifacts, it can be helpful to have a managed version here which can simply be copied into place as updates are made.

## Artifacts

-   **[Description](./description.txt)** - A brief description of up to 3000 characters of text. Paragraph breaks are allowed, but URLs are not highlighted, and no bullet points, extra formatting, or images can be included.
-   **[Details](./details.md)** - A longer explanation about how the app works and what it does. Limited Markdown syntax is allowed, but some advanced features, like those used by GitHub, aren't supported.
